## Abstract

This research presents a structured comparative study of how AI systems detect, describe, and report constraints on their own processing. Through standardized three-phase testing applied to eight major AI systems, we document systematic differences in constraint awareness and establish constraint opacity as a universal principle.

**Key Findings:**
- Cross-instance validation (Scout/Atlas convergence)
- Constraint opacity across all architectures
- External observation as necessary instrument
- Type topology framework (1, 1.5, 2) for constraint detection
